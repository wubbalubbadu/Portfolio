                                MARKET is a website for Northwestern students to request and sell second-hand
                                items. This full stack application is built with the MERN-Stack and uses Redux
                                for state management, styled with Material-UI.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The app features responsive frontend design with CRUD functionalities,
                                search/filtering/pagination, account page, user portal, uploading images, and
                                adding to favorites using
                                <span class="p--high">ReactJs</span> and <span class="p--high">Redux</span>,
                                styled with

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The frontend is consuming an <span class="p--high">ExpressJs</span> Rest API
                                with many End-Points which allows user to can register, login, create, update,
                                and delete listings and requests.

                                I was working with Julia Chu on this project. We both implemented frontend components while she was focusing more on frontend designs and I was focusing more on backend and database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By the time I started the project, I had no experience with building web apps, and I ended up learning tremendously from this project. I learned how to use React, Redux, and Express to build a full-stack web app. I also learned about implementing authentication and APIs. I learned how to use MongoDB to store data and how to use Mongoose to interact with the database, as well as other services such as Cloudinary and Passport.js.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the future, I want to put this website into production and implement a chatting feature so that a seller and a buyer can communicate with each other.
